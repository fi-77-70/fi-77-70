## About Me:

Hi, I’m Filipe — a software developer currently advancing through the 42 Porto program. My journey began with C and C++, and I've since gained hands-on experience with Python, Shell scripting, SQL, and server technologies like Nginx and Apache. I enjoy tackling low-level programming challenges and constantly improving through peer-to-peer learning.

Take a look at my projects to see what I’ve been building!
